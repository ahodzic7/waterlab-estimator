# Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Combined Sewer Overflows in Urban Drainage Networks
## Masters Thises in Control and Automation 
This repo has the objective of covering the "code" produced as part of Adis and Caspers Mater Thises at Aalborg University.

The thises plan includes the following tasksÂ¨.
1. System identification:
System identification (Grey-box) of gravity pipes, relying on the physical
laws described by the Saint-Venant hyperbolic Partial Differential
Equations.

2. State estimation:
Full state observability in sewer applications is typically not available,
hence only some subsets of states are measured.

3. Stochastic Model Predictive Control:
Although standard MPC methods offer a certain degree of robustness,
stochastic MPC is a natural extension to deal with the uncertainties
systematically.

4. Multi-objective optimization:
Control in UDNs is typically proposed as a multi-criteria optimization with
conflicting objectives, where operational objectives and the choice of
weighing parameters needs to be considered for the optimization
problem.
